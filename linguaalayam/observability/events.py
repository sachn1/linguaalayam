"""Feature-usage analytics events logged outside RequestLoggingMiddleware's generic
per-request classification — either because the "event" isn't its own HTTP request
(e.g. Varnam's manglish fallback, triggered inside /search's handling) or because it
needs a route_type the generic path-prefix classifier can't express (e.g. distinguishing
which button on /track/click was actually clicked).
