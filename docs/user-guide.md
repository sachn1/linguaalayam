# User Guide

LinguAalayam is a Malayalam dictionary that searches across four open corpora — in English, Malayalam, or Manglish.

## How search works

Type a word in the search bar and results appear automatically. There is no mode to switch — the search engine finds the best matches using trigram similarity, which naturally ranks exact matches at the top followed by close variants.

- Type **English** to find Malayalam definitions: *run*, *happiness*, *ephemeral*
- Type **Malayalam** to find definitions in any direction: *ഓടുക*, *സന്തോഷം*
- Type **Manglish** (romanised Malayalam) to find Malayalam results: *oduka*, *santhosham*, *veedu*
- Type a **description or phrase** to find the word: *feeling of nostalgia*, *complete absence of sound*

## Voice search

On browsers that support speech recognition (Chrome, Edge, Safari), a microphone icon appears inside the search bar. Tap it, speak, and the transcribed text is searched automatically. The first time you use it, a short prompt asks which language you'll be speaking — your choice is remembered after that. You can change it anytime via the flag icon next to the mic, which stays visibly grouped with it so it's clear it controls the *voice* language, not the interface or search language.

## Corpora (source filter)

LinguAalayam searches four open Malayalam corpora. Leave the filter on **All** to search everything at once.

| Filter | Corpora | Direction | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|
| **All** | All four | — | General search |
| **English → Malayalam** | Olam | EN → ML | Translating an English word |
| **All Malayalam → Malayalam** | Datuk + Sayahna | ML → ML | Understanding a Malayalam word |
| **Datuk** | Datuk | ML → ML | Contemporary Malayalam definitions |
| **Sayahna** | Shabdataaravali (1917) | ML → ML | Classical/archaic Malayalam |
| **Thesaurus → Ekkurup** | Ekkurup | EN thesaurus | English synonyms with Malayalam equivalents |

Shabdataaravali uses 1917 Malayalam orthography. Headwords ending in `ு்` are archaic word-boundary markers, not errors.

## Clickable words

Malayalam words in definitions are clickable when they exist as their own dictionary entry. Clicking a word searches for it directly.

---

## AI synthesis (optional)

By default, results are raw dictionary entries. Open [Settings](/settings) (the gear icon) and toggle "Enable AI synthesis" — no key needed, this uses a server-side model. The app reads the top results and writes a plain-English explanation alongside them, in whichever language you've picked with the input-language flag next to the search box.

Prefer a different model, or want to use your own account? Expand "Use your own API key instead" in Settings.

### How to get a key

| Provider | Where | Key format |
|---|---|---|
| TogetherAI (Qwen) | [api.together.ai/settings/keys](https://api.together.ai/settings/keys) | alphanumeric |
| Anthropic (Claude) | [console.anthropic.com/settings/keys](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys) | `sk-ant-…` |
| OpenAI (GPT) | [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) | `sk-…` |

**Privacy:** your key is stored only in your browser's `localStorage`. It is sent directly to the AI provider with each request and never stored on LinguAalayam's servers.

## Tips

- **No results?** Try removing the corpus filter.
- **Manglish search:** *oduka* → *ഓടുക* is powered by [Varnam](https://varnamproject.com) (Subin Siby).
- **Word valid in both languages?** Some words are real in both English and Manglish (*kali* → the goddess Kali, or *കലി*, "anger"). When that happens, the English result shows as usual, with a collapsed "Did you mean this in Malayalam?" link below it.
- **Morphological context:** for Malayalam queries, the base form and grammatical role are shown above results, powered by [mlmorph](https://morph.smc.org.in/).
- **MCP for AI assistants:** LinguAalayam is available as an MCP server at `https://linguaalayam.org/mcp`. See the [MCP setup guide](../linguaalayam/mcp/README.md) to connect Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, or Cline.
